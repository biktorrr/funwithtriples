Android devices communicate using Bluetooth.</p>

Once two Android devices are near they both send a <i>unite(D)</i>
command to the server, where <i>D</i> is the device name of the other
device.

The server stores triples related to the devices. The server starts
out with triples for each of the devices, instantiating the use case
'Einstein's Riddle' (see below).
