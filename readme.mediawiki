=Server communication=

==Game initialization==

At the beginning of the game devices send <i>welcome(DEV_ID)</i> to the server.

The server returns a JSON reply (see below) to device <i>DEV_ID</i>.

==Game run==

When Android devices connect over Bluetooth they both send a
<i>unite(DEV_ID)</i> command to the server.

The server returns a JSON reply (see below) to these two devices.
